# Headliner Tycoon: project rules for every coding agent

## Documentation map (read and keep current)

Important per-system facts live in `docs/*.md`, not only in this file. Start at
`docs/README.md`, then open the topic file for the feature you touch.

| Pathfinding, crowding, caches | `docs/pathfinding.md` |
| Visitors, needs, thoughts | `docs/visitors.md` |
| Camping / gatherings | `docs/camping.md` |
| Buildings, catalog, scenery | `docs/buildings.md` |
| Copy / build library | `docs/blueprints.md` |
| Themed decoration / Deko tab | `docs/decoration.md` |
| Terrain, ground, way types | `docs/terrain.md` |
| Roads, depots, freight, lights | `docs/logistics.md` |
| Band supply / backstage / tour bus | `docs/band-supply.md` |

| Saves / snapshot fields | `docs/saves.md` |
| Tests / how to run checks | `docs/testing.md` |
| Measured performance | `docs/performance.md` |
| Layers / where to dock a feature | `docs/architecture.md` |

A feature or fix is incomplete until the matching topic MD is updated:

- Changed behaviour, files, invariants or tests → edit that topic MD.
- New feature → extend an existing topic MD or add `docs/<topic>.md` and list it
  in `docs/README.md` and in the table above.
- New `GameCommand` or snapshot field → also update `docs/multiplayer.md` and
  `docs/saves.md`.
- New balancing key → `src/game/simulationConfig.ts` plus the topic MD.
- Player-visible controls or rules → root `README.md`.

Do not leave new modules, commands or kinds undocumented.

## Hard invariants

- Preserve existing gameplay, save compatibility and host-authoritative multiplayer.
- Increment the package patch version for feature/fix batches; the visible version comes from package.json. Keep the lockfile in sync.
- Simulation time is authoritative: fixed 100 ms ticks; speed indices 1/2/3 mean 1×/3×/8×. Rendering only interpolates. Never run decisions or mutate game state from render frames.
- Bound destination decisions with `SIMULATION_CONFIG.pathfinding.decisionsPerTick`, including direct arrival/interaction callbacks. Deferred requests must drain fairly; urgent state transitions and movement/needs still advance every tick.
- Deterministic budgets use work counts/simTick, never Date.now(), performance.now(), FPS or local device speed. Profiling clocks are diagnostics only.
- Do not nest full visitor scans inside visitor/camp/staff loops. Build spatial/occupancy indexes once per pass and update reservations incrementally.
- When many destinations are interchangeable, use ONE multi-goal route search. Never run A* once for every tent/gathering place/building. `CampingSystem.findRouteToGathering` is a regression-critical example (335 installations in rtest3).
- Topology/access changes invalidate navigation immediately. Crowd cost changes use bounded, staggered route-cache expiry. Do not clear the entire cache on every crowd update or when the cache reaches capacity. Budget-limited misses are not proof of unreachability.
- Keep terrain, crowding, staff/load penalties and alternate routes functional. Do not improve benchmarks by freezing visitors, skipping admissions, disabling effects or slowing game time.
- Static model details use shared, merged geometry/vertex colors and instancing. Never add a material/draw call per plank, bottle, bolt or visitor. Keep animated stages, lighting, picking and overlays outside static batches.
- Scenery uses optional `decorationSlot` (four quarters or edges). Missing slots are legacy full-tile objects; never silently shrink old saves. Placement, previews, collision checks and multiplayer must use the shared `scenery.ts` rules. Instanced scenery carries building IDs for picking.
- Before completing simulation/render changes run `npm test` and `npm run build`. Frame-partition determinism, camp multi-goal search, decision queues, cache refresh and asset draw-call bounds are covered by tests.
- For performance work run `npm run test:performance -- rtest3 120` before/after and a longer 1200-tick run. Use `PROFILE_METHODS=1` for inclusive method timing (PowerShell: `$env:PROFILE_METHODS='1'`). Never commit/overwrite personal saves. The script accepts a save name or snapshot/slot JSON path.
- Compare identical fixtures and distinguish CPU tick timing from actual browser FPS. Inspect 1×, 3× and 8× and report median/p95/max plus visitor counts; a long run can end the festival and empty the park.
- See `docs/performance.md` for measured baseline, limits and reproduction. Update it when changing the scheduling or rendering architecture. Update `docs/simulation.md` / `docs/rendering.md` when those architectures change.
